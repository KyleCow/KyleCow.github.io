    <p>There is a unique path from any corner to another by following the arrows. You can go in the direction of the arrows or if there is a circle on a corner you can stay still</p>
    <p>The following is a convex polyhedron with edges labeled such that there is a unique length 2 path from any corner to another by following the arrows. You can go in the direction of the arrows or if there is a circle on a corner you can stay still</p>
    <p>If this circle bit upsets you there is a fairly simple proof that any directed graph with n vertices and with a unique distance 2 path between any 2 points must have at exactly sqrt(n) loops so this is unavoidable</p>
    <p>This property is vaguely interesting as this means that sqrt(n) must be an integer, for 4 corners we can do a square and for 9 we can do this Tri-Augmented Triangular Prism, i would conjecture that there are no other convex shapes with this property but i dont have a proof right now. The construction that gives this graph for n=9 gives a square for n=4 and non-planar graphs for 9&lt;n&lt;1226 so presumably they are never planar beyond this point so cannot be made into shapes</p>
    <p>We can also derive that there if there is n^2 corners there have to be n arrows pointing in and n pointing out of each corner (this bit is harder to see)</p>

    <p>The actual maths is as follows. If we let A be the adjacancy matrix of the graph we are looking for a matrix whos entries are positive integers and who squares to the matrix of all ones</p>
    <p>Since the matrix of all ones has eigenvalues of 0,...,0,n, A must have eigenvalues of 0,...,0,Â±sqrt(n). The number of loops is then the trace which is the sum of these values</p>
    <p>so since the trace is a positive integer its sqrt(n) which must be an integer</p>
    <p>By noting that (A^2)^2 = nA^2 we see that A^2(A^2-n)=0 so letting m^2 = n, A^2(A-m)(A+m)=0, we also see that the characteristic polynomial of A is A^{n-1}(A-m) since we know the eigenvalues (since we already know that n is an integer square and 1 is boring we can assume that n>3 so n-1>2)</p>
    <p>So the minimal polynomial must divide both of these polynomials so must divide A^2(A-m) so A^2A=A^2m. Since each entry of A^2A will give you the sum over a row we see that the sum over each row is m</p>
    <p>So there is m arrows pointing out of any vertex, also since (A^t)^2 = (A^2)^t = A^2 the same applies to the collumns so there is m arrows pointing into each vertex too</p>
    <p>We can see an example construction by taking the matrix S that is the mxm identity with the rows cycled along one place then taking the block matrix A = [[S^0, S^1, S^2 ... S^{m-1}],[S^0, S^1, S^2 ... S^{m-1}]...[S^0, S^1, S^2 ... S^{m-1}]]</p>
    <p>Then since the sum of S^m is the matrix of all 1s we get that this matrix squared is what we want</p>
