    <p>There is a unique path from any corner to another by following the arrows. You can go in the direction of the arrows or if there is a circle on a corner you can stay still</p>
    <p>The following is a convex polyhedron with edges labeled such that there is a unique length 2 path from any corner to another by following the arrows. You can go in the direction of the arrows or if there is a circle on a corner you can stay still<br/>If this circle bit upsets you there is a fairly simple proof that any directed graph with n vertices and with a unique distance 2 path between any 2 points must have at exactly sqrt(n) loops so this is unavoidable<br/>This property is vaguely interesting as this means that sqrt(n) must be an integer, for 4 corners we can do a square and for 9 we can do this Tri-Augmented Triangular Prism, i would conjecture that there are no other convex shapes with this property but i dont have a proof right now. The construction that gives this graph for n=9 gives a square for n=4 and non-planar graphs for 9<n<1226 so presumably they are never planar beyond this point so cannot be made into shapes

We can also derive that there if there is n^2 corners there have to be n arrows pointing in and n pointing out of each corner (this bit is harder to see)</p>
