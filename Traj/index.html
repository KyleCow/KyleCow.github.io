    <h1>Trajectory Equasion</h1>
    <p id = 'eqn'> `t(x)=tan(theta)x-(gx^2)/(2v^2cos^2theta)`</p>
    <h2>The shape</h2>
    <p>We want to find the equation of the path of an object with weight<br>
      this object has a constant acceleration downwards since gravity is constant<br>
      when graphed the direction of travel or tangent describes the direction of velocity<br>
      This velocity needs to change by a constant ammount so the rate of change of velocity has to be constant<br>
      The velocity being tangent is just the derivitive of the function<br>
      So the rate of change of velocity is the second derivitive of the function<br>
      So in order to get the type of function we need a function that's second derivitive is constant which is a parabola<br>
      <u>(proof)</u><br>
      `int (n) dx = nx`,`int (nx) dx = n/2x^2`<br>
      so we now need to find a parabola or `x^2` graph that would show the path of a thrown object
    <h2>The equation</h2>
    <p>Start with finding the distance<br>
      The object starts with an angle `theta` and velocity `v`<br>
      The velocity can be split into two components horizontal(`v_h`) and vertical(`v_u`)<br></p>
    <img src = 'assets/triange.png'/><br>
    <p>This shows that `v_h=vcos(theta)` and `v_u=vsin(theta)`, this will be useful later<br></p>
    <img src = 'assets/parablo.png'/><br>
    <p>We can find this distance `d` because at the turning point `v_u=0`<br>
      so it takes a time of `v_u/g`, `g` being gravitational acceleration, for it to reach this point<br>
      since its traveling to the right at a speed of `v_h` and `d=st` we can express the distance `d` as `(v_uv_h)/g`<br>
      and this can be expressed in terms of `v` as `(v^2sin(theta)cos(theta))/g`<br>
      this is only half of the full distance however, so the full distance is</p>
    <p id = 'eqn'>`(2v^2sin(theta)cos(theta))/g`</p>
    <p>Since it passes through the origin (0,0) the full equasion is going to be `ax^2 + bx`<br>
      At 0 the gradient is going to be `theta`<br>
      As the gradient of a quadratic can be expressed as `2ax+b`<br>
      Since at this point `x=0` the gradient is just `2a*0+b` or just `b`<br>
      You can convert between angles and gradients with the `tan` function</p>
    <img src = 'assets/dydx.png'/><br>
    <p>Since `tan(theta)=(opp)/(adj)` and gradient is `(Deltay)/(Deltax)`<br>
      In this case `tan(theta)=(Deltay)/(Deltax)`<br>
      So in the equasion `b=tan(theta)` thus it is `ax^2+tan(theta)x`<br>
      Now we need to find a value for `a`<br>
      When `ax^2+bx+c=0`, `x = (-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac})/(2a)`<br>
      And in our case x = 0 at 0 and `(2v^2sin(theta)cos(theta))/g`<br>
      and `b = tan(theta)` so<br>
      `x = (-tan(theta) \pm \sqrt{(tan(theta))^2-4ac})/(2a)`<br>
      Meaning that<br>
      `(2v^2sin(theta)cos(theta))/g = (-tan(theta) \pm \sqrt{(tan(theta))^2-4ac})/(2a)`<br>
      Since `c = 0` due to the graph passing through the origin this can be simplified to<br></p>
      <p id = 'eqn'>`(2v^2sin(theta)cos(theta))/g = (-tan(theta) \pm tan(theta))/(2a)`</p>
      <p>Rearanging slightly we get</p>
      <p id = 'eqn'>`a(4v^2sin(theta)cos(theta))/g =-tan(theta) \pm tan(theta)`</p>
      <p>This can mean either</p>
      <p id = 'eqn'>`a(4v^2sin(theta)cos(theta))/g = 0`<br>
        thus at least one of the variables = 0 and none of them should<br>
        or<br>
        `a(4v^2sin(theta)cos(theta))/g = -2tan(theta)`</p>
      <p>Due to the fact that `tan(theta)=(sin(theta))/(cos(theta))`<br>
        We can replace `tan(theta)` with `(sin(theta))/(cos(theta))`<br>
        This will make simplifying easyer down the road<br>
        With a bit of rearanging we get `((-sin(theta))/cos(theta))/((2v^2sin(theta)cos(theta))/g)`<br>
        Since `(a/b)/(c/d) = (ad)/(bc)`<br>
        This simplifys to `(-sin(theta)g)/(2cos(theta)v^2sin(theta)cos(theta))`<br>
        the `sin(theta)`'s cancel out leaving us with</p>
      <p id = 'eqn'>`a = -g/(2v^2(cos(theta)^2))`</p>
      <p>This gives us a final equasion of</p>
      <p id = 'eqn'>`t(x)=tan(theta)x-(gx^2)/(2v^2cos^2theta)`</p>
      <p style="font-size:small">I used `t(x)` because its <b>t</b>rajectory</p>
      <p>From this equasion you can calculate the maximum height<br>
        To do this you can use the fact that the maximum point of a parabola is<br>
        `((-b)/(2a),c-(b^2)/(4a))`<br>
        since<br>
        `a=-g/(2v^2cos^2theta)`and `b=tantheta`<br>
        The coordinates are going to be<br>
        `((-tantheta)/(2(-g/(2v^2cos))),-((tan^2theta)/(4(-g/(2v^2cos^2theta)))))`<br>
        You can rearange these to be<br>
        `((v^2cos^2(theta)tan(theta))/g,(v^2tan^2(theta)cos^2(theta))/(2g))`<br>
        so the maximum height is `(v^2tan^2(theta)cos^2(theta))/(2g)`
