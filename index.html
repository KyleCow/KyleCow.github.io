            <br> Let `M` be a manifold, that means that we have some open cover `\{U_i\}` such that for each open set `U_i` we have some `\varphi_i: U_i \to \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}` which is a
            homeomorphism and these homeomorphisms are "smooth". That is that if `U_i` and `U_j` intersect (call the intersection `V` for brevity), the composition map `\varphi_j \circ \varphi_i^{-1}: \varphi_i(V)\to \varphi_j(V)` 
            is smooth (`C^{\infty}`)</p><br>

            <br><p class="txt" > This notion can be generalised where instead of taking `\mathbb{R}^n` as our so called "model space" we instead take just a general topological space `S`, similarly instead of requiring that the
          composition/transition map be `C^{\infty}` we can just replace it by some `\Gamma` which is called a pseudogroup, essentially all it is is a space of homeomorphisms such that we maintain properties such as composition, inverses, restrictions, , and glueing (we if we have a bunch of functions covering a space we can stick them all together and we still have such a function) Basically all of the obvious requirements for it to act as a space of homeomorphisms. This is, at least for now, abstraction for the sake of abstraction and should only be seen as a useful generalisation not as the fundamental intuition</p>
          <p class="txt" >The definition of a manifold is then, just a Hausdorf, Second countable topological space such that we have this so called 'atlas', an atlas is just the collection of pairs \(U_i, \varphi_i\) that behave as we've seen, if the maps in this atlas are to \(\mathbb{R}^n\) we say the manifold has dimension \(n\)</p>
	<p class = "txt">The first thing you do if you find a new object is to find some examples, the second thing you want to do is try to construct the category of these objects, for this you need morphisms. We define the morphisms on this category of smooth manifolds as continuous maps $f$ between manifolds satisfying that for our charts \((U_i, \varphi_i), (V_j, \phi_j\) the composition $\phi_j \circ f \circ \varphi_i$ is smooth (\(C^{\infty}\)). The diagram for this composition is the same as before except in this case the two open sets that we put at the top are in different manifolds so type checking the images is slightly different.</p>
	<p class = "txt">The third thing you want to do is see if you can make new from old, that is how can we get manifolds from manifolds we already have, one way is to take the obvious product manifold \(M\times N\) with atlas \((U_i\times V_j, \varphi_i \times \phi_j)\) this is useful but not particularly interesting</p>      
	<p class = "txt">For a more interesting object we can construct submanifolds, that is what you would expect, a manifold inside another manifold. If \(M\) is a manifold with dimension \(d\) then we say some subset \(Y \subset M\) is a submanifold of dimension \(e\) if for any point \(y \in Y\) we can find some chart on \(M\) \((U, \varphi)\) with \(y \in U\) where \[\varphi(U\cap Y) = \varphi(U) \cap \mathbb{R}^e\] </p>
	<p class = "txt">We might also say that \(Y\) has codimension \(d-e\). This definition seems strange at first glance but to unravel it a little bit, all it's saying is that for any point we can find some neighborhood such that when we map over to \(\mathbb{R}^d\) the submanifold we want just looks like some part of \(\mathbb{R}^{e}\) and if we choose our chart right, it looks exactly like some open subset of \(\mathbb{R}^e\) with the obvious inclusion into \(\mathbb{R}^d\)</p>
	<p class = "txt">It might be worth checking that this is a manifold in its own right, but this follows pretty quickly so I'm not going to bother checking the conditions, intuitively if we have two charts satisfying the conditions then their composition will be smooth becuase theyre already smooth on \(M\)</p>
	<p class = "txt">One area where this is useful is by using the inverse function theorem, we can show that level sets are manifolds as long as the jacobian is non singular, that is, the level set doesnt get pinched or folded anywhere, at any point it is basically its derivative, a flat affine linear map of the input space.</p>	      
      	<p class = "txt">Put rigourously, if for every point \(y\) we have a chart \((U,\varphi)\) along with a smooth map \[f:\varphi(U)\to \mathbb{R}^c\] the level set of this function is the same as \(Y\) near \(y\) \[Y\cap U = \{p\in U \vert f(\varphi(p))=0\}\] where the jacobian determinant is non zero then this is a submanifold of codimension c.
	<p class = "txt">This is just a consequence of the Inverse Function Theorem, since the function \(f\) is technically a map from \(\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^c\) we cant take the derivative straight away but if we just add a bunch of identity maps we can turn this into a map from \(\mathbb{R}^d\to \mathbb{R}^d\) and this setup is the exact same except we restrict ourselves to the obvious inclusion of \(\mathbb{R}^{d-c}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^d\)</p>
	<p class = "txt">But once this is done we just have a jacobian  that looks like \[\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j} & \text{some stuff we dont care about, essentially the extra input dimensions we can ignore} \\ 0 & id\end{pmatrix}\] which by our assumption has determinant not zero so thanks to the inverse function theorem, \(Y\) is a manifold if it locally looks like the vanishing of some function</p>
	<p class = "txt">Now we get to the reason I started writing all of this stuff, getting the proof of quotient manifolds right. I think at this point its a good idea to bring in some concrete examples, we want to find something we can modulo by to create a manifold, we cant just do anything for example if we imagine taking a line | and quotient out by the top point and the middle we het something that looks like the letter P, this clearly isnt a manifold at the point of contact so we need to be more careful about this</p>
	<p class = "txt">How about we try quotienting out by some action, like, we'll say two points are the same in the quotient if one is mapped to the other under some map, we'll make it a diffeomorphism to make sure these maps are well behaved. We could also have more than one map, as long as compositions are fine we can equivocate two points if we can find a map that takes one to the other</p>
	<p class = "txt">Given some group of diffeomorphisms \(G\) we will call this quotient (the set of all \(G\)-orbits) \(M/G\) whch comes with the normal quotient topology. It'll turn out we want more requirements on \(G\) but we'll get to that as we prove it.</p>
	<p class = "txt">Proofish: Lets say we have some open neighborhood in our quotient, we want some way to mape this continuously up to some chart of \(M\) which we can then send to some \(\mathbb{R}^n\) the issue is its inverse image is almost defininitly not a function so we'd have to pick some outputs in a nice enough way that this is still continuous. Lets say we take a point \(q\) in the quotient to some \(p\) in the manifold, if p is close to one of its images under \(G\) we'll have an issue because we have to skip that point making possibly a discontinuity.
	<p class = "txt">To avoid this problem we'll restrict our group a little, we'll make it so that if we have two compact subsets, we would like it if no maps in \(G\) made them intersect because then we wouldnt have to deal with translates at all. Alas we will have to settle for there being finitely many group elements that make them intersect, that is for two compact subsets \(K_1, K_2\) \[\{g\in G\vert g(K_1)\cap K_2 \neq \emptyset\}\] is finite. We also want to remove fixed points (except for the identity) because if everything around a point is glued together but the point isnt the space probably wont be smooth there</p>
	<p class = "txt">Ok lets start again, let \(G\) be whats called, properly discontinuous with no fixed points, then we want to show that the quotient manifold is a manifold. To do so pick some point \(x\) in the manifold, let \(U_1 \supset U_2 \supset U_3\supset \ldots\) be a base of open neighborhoods of \(x\) such that any of their closures are compact, this is called relatively compact. We then construct the set \[F_i = \{g \in G \vert g(U_i)\cap U_i \neq \emptyset\}\] each of these sets is finite because each \(U_i\) is contained in a compact set. Additionally if the sets get smaller, some of the functions that made them intersect wont do that anymore so \[F_1 \supset F_2 \supset \ldots\]</p>
	<p class = "txt">If theres some \(g\) that is in all of these \(F_m\)s then because it will always intersect a neigborhood we can construct a sequence of points that are in each neighborhood and get mapped into that neighborhood, this sequence will converge to \(x\) (and only \(x\) due to hausdorff property) because we have a base of neighborhoods, similarly their images will converge to \(x\) so we have that \(g(x)=x\) which because we require there to be no fixed points means that \(g=id\)</p>
	<p class = "txt">So by taking small enough \(U\) for each point we can cover \(M\) with open sets \(U_i\) that if \(p_1 \neq p_2 \in V_i\) then for any \(g\), \(g(p_1)\neq g(p_2)\), so when we map these down to their equivalence classes/orbits this map is injective on this open set. We then define \(V_i' = \pi(U_i)\). Giving these sets the structure we want gives us the smooth structure. That is if we have a chart \(U, \varphi\) on \(U_i\) we then let \((V', \varphi')\) be the chart on \(V_i'\) with \(\varphi'([p]) = \varphi(p)\). Thanks to injectivity this is essentially just an identification. This gives us the smooth structure on \(M/G\) </p>
	<p class = "txt">Its worth noting that that last bit just the usual universal property of a quotient, that is if you have a map, in this case chart, from a space to another, in this case \(U\subset M\) to \(\mathbb{R}^n\) that doesnt care about which representative  you chose from an equivalence class, which it doesnt by construction. We can find a unique map from the quotient space to \( \mathbb{R}^n \) that the composition works, and because these spaces are topological, importantly this map is continuous.</p>
